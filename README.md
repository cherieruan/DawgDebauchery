Welcome to DawgDebauchery, UW's mobile application for the best parties.
With an account, users can view nearby events based on their location. As users walk, they will
be notified that they are passing an event, with the event details and the option to save.
Events can either be public or private. For private events, users can request an invitation for the
event host to approve. If a user wishes to host an event, they can post their event with details
on this application for others to view and save. If they wish to host a private event, they can approve
and disapprove invitation requests from other users, in a Tinder-like fashion.
